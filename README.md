# Goat query builder

This is an SQL query builder built over a PHP to SQL and SQL to PHP type converter.

Working with PDO as of today (MySQL >= 5 and PostGreSQL >= 9 are officially supported).

Sorry, this needs some more documentation.

## Future

 - ext_pgsql support for connexion,
 - Symfony bundle with Doctrine support.
